# Pokédex

A modern Pokédex web application that allows users to browse, search, and view detailed information about Pokémon. The frontend is built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite** for fast performance, while **Tailwind CSS** is used for a clean, responsive UI. The app consumes the public PokéAPI to fetch Pokémon data and present it in an easy-to-use interface.
